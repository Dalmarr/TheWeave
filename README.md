# TheWeave
The Weave is a discussion forum website that allows registered users to engage in online discussions, while unregistered users can view the discussions/threads, similar to websites like Reddit and HackerNews. The goal of this project was to produce a similar service that allows users to register, post discussion topics, comment, and reply.
